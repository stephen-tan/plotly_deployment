# Plotly Deployment

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create interactive charts using the JavaScript Plotly library to examine belly button biodiversity.<br/>

## Results
https://stephen-tan.github.io/plotly_deployment/

The webpage has three charts: bar (upper left), gauge (upper right), and bubble (bottom). These charts are dynamically updated based on the Test Subject ID Number selected.</br>

In order to reset the Test Subject ID Number, the webpage can be refreshed or another Test Suject ID can be selected from the dropdown menu. </br></br>
